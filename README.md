# Overview
The Tunisian Coin Detector is an Android application designed to identify and sum Tunisian coins using a camera interface. The app leverages a TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) model, which was trained on a dataset collected and converted from YOLO, to ensure accurate detection of various coin denominations. Users can quickly get the total value of the coins detected through their device's camera, making it a handy tool for both casual users and professionals.
**This app solves the problem** by leveraging advanced image recognition technology to detect coins in real-time through your device's camera. By using a TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) model, which was trained on a comprehensive dataset converted from the YOLO framework, users can effortlessly identify coins and obtain their total value, making transactions quicker and more efficient.


# Who Would Benefit from This Tool
- **Retailers and Merchants:** Easily verify and sum coins received in transactions.
- **Tourists:** Quickly identify and understand the value of coins in a foreign country.
- **Students and Researchers:** Useful for studying image recognition and machine learning applications in real-world scenarios.


# Technologies Used
- **Kotlin:** Primary programming language for Android app development.
- **Java:** Secondary language used within the app.
- **TensorFlow Lite:** Lightweight machine learning framework for mobile and embedded devices.
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once):** Object detection algorithm used for training the model.
- **Android Studio:** Integrated development environment (IDE) used for building the application.

# Features
- Real-time detection of Tunisian coins through the camera.
- Accurate identification of various coin denominations.
